# Linear Regression using Gradient descent
 
## Overview:
	* This is a small project made by Nguyen Long Quang while learning the "Machine Learning" course of Andrew Ng.
	* The goal is to predict the "output" variable Y given the "intput" variable X and a trainning set.
	* This project used:
		- Linear Regression model.
		- Gradient descent algorithm (with Feature Scaling) for multiple variables.

## Usage:
	1. Input the number of training example you have.
	2. Input number of features of "X's".
	3. Input traning set.
	4. Input the example X needed prediction Y.
	5. Receive the answer.

	*For example:
		Input number of training examples: 3
		Input number of features: 2
		Input training set:
		1 2 3
		4 5 6
		7 8 9
		Input X: 10 11
		Prediction of Y: 12
